## Description

RapidWebView is a library for your Android application which allows you to load websites in a webview with a minimal TTI ([Time To Interactive](https://web.dev/interactive/)). It also provides a generic set of Javascript Interface functions which can let your website interact with some Android native functionalities.

### Features

- Asset cache - keeps a local copy of website assets provided by you during initialisation. Supports asset versioning as well.
- WebView request interceptor - intercepts requests made by webview and serves assets from local copy reducing the website "Time to interactive" time. 
- Javascript interface - a generic collection of javascript interface functions which can be used to interactive with native application

### Performance    
We enabled webview content debugging (`setWebContentsDebuggingEnabled(true)`) and used Lighthouse from Chrome DevTools to measure performance of
the pages loaded with and without RapidWebView SDK. The results can be seen below. A 67.2% improvement in TTI!
